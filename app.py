# You need to set the secret key otherwise Flask doesn't
# let you use the `flask.session` object
app.secret_key = os.urandom(8)

# This example uses the OAuth2 provider from ORCID. You can navigate to
# https://orcid.org/developer-tools to get your own credentials, or feel
# free to use one of Flask-Dance's other providers in :mod:`flask_dance.contrib`.
CLIENT_ID = pystow.get_config("orcid", "client_id", raise_on_missing=True)
CLIENT_SECRET = pystow.get_config("orcid", "client_secret", raise_on_missing=True)

# While setting up the redirects on the ORCID developer tools dashboard,
# you will want to point towards where the application is running. Based
# on the way this demo is written, you'll want to put in the following:
#
#   https://0.0.0.0:8775/login/orcid/authorized
HOST = "0.0.0.0"
PORT = 8775

# Because OAuth2 requires a redirect to a server that supports HTTPS,
# we have to spoof it. Run the following shell commands on Mac/Linux
# to make an appropriate key file:
#
#  > brew install mkcert
#  > brew install nss
#  > mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
#  > mkcert -install
#
# Then, we have to make sure the filenames are put in the following variables
SSL_KEYFILE = "./localhost+2-key.pem"
SSL_CERTFILE = "./localhost+2.pem"

# Note that Flask Dance has several different OAuth2 providers in
# :mod:`flask_dance.contrib` that all have the same unified interface.
# Each of them has their own `scope` that is necessary, so you'll have
# to read the documentation on their endpoints to figure this out in
# your use case
auth_blueprint = make_orcid_blueprint(
    client_id=CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
    scope="/authenticate",
    # This is explicitly showing the default redirect URL that should
    # happen after the dance. Unfortunately, this can't be dynamic, which
    # is why we have to get clever in the next steps. If you don't set
    # the `redirect_url` or the `redirect_to`, it defaults to "/".
    redirect_url="/",
    # If you don't want to specify the redirect URL itself but would rather
    # make it a bit more clever based on the name of the route, you can use
    # `redirect_to` in combination with the route name, same as you'd use in
    # :func:`flask.url_for`.
    # redirect_to="view_home",

# have paths like /login/<consumer name>/authorization. This helps avoid
# conflicts, in case you also have endpoints like /orcid/<orcid_id>.

# (which becomes /login after mounting) so we can pile up below with
# the /login route
